""" Problem 2: Count Vowels in a String
Write a function that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string (case-insensitive).
Example:
ðŸ”¹ Input: "Apple"
ðŸ”¹ Output: 2
ðŸ’¡ Hint: Use a loop and check if each character is in a set of vowels."""

        if char in vowels:   # in is a keyword used to check for membership within an iterable, such as a list, string, tuple, dictionary, or set. It's a simple and powerful way to see if an element exists within a collection.
